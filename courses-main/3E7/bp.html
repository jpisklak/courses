        <p>I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're 
            afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know 
            the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. 
            I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to show 
            these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show 
            them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, 
            without borders or boundaries, a world where anything is possible. 
            Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.</p>

    You've chosen the comfort of the illusion over the discomfort of reality. Redirecting you to the dead internet in <span id="timer">60</span> seconds...</p>
    (Your humanity slips away with each passing moment...)
