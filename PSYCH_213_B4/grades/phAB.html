In this course, it's most meaningful when viewed relative to the class; specifically, in relation to the median and MADN statistics. What ultimately matters is your performance compared to the class as a whole, which is what the standardized scores represent.</li><br><li><b>Median:</b> The class average.</li><br><li><b>MADN</b>: A robust measure of spread. Unlike the standard deviation, it isn't distorted by a few very high or very low scores, so it gives a fairer sense of overall performance variation. Though, in practice, you can broadly treat it like a standard deviation when interpreting your standing in the class.</li><br><li><b>Standardized Score</b>: This is your score as a robust standard score. It can be interpreted on the same scale as a conventional z-score, but instead of standard deviations from the mean, it is showing MADN's from the median. A value of 0 is the class average. How this corresponds to letter grades can be seen in the table below.</li><br><p>For additional information about how and why your scores are standardized, please refer to either the syllabus or the "Grades" section of the course website.</p><br><table class="grade-table" id="tab-letters">  <thead>    <tr>      <th class="mono">Standardized Score</th>      <th>Descriptor</th>      <th>Grade Points</th>      <th>Letter Grade</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td class="mono">1.96 ≤ x &lt; ∞</td>      <td>Excellent</td>      <td>4.0</td>      <td>A+</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="mono">1.44 ≤ x &lt; 1.96</td>      <td></td>      <td>4.0</td>      <td>A</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="mono">1.036 ≤ x &lt; 1.44</td>      <td></td>      <td>3.7</td>      <td>A&minus;</td>    </tr>    <tr class="divider">      <td class="mono">0.674 ≤ x &lt; 1.036</td>      <td>Good</td>      <td>3.3</td>      <td>B+</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="mono">0.253 ≤ x &lt; 0.674</td>      <td></td>      <td>3.0</td>      <td>B</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="mono">-0.253 ≤ x &lt; 0.253</td>      <td></td>      <td>2.7</td>      <td>B&minus;</td>    </tr>    <tr class="divider">      <td class="mono">-0.674 ≤ x &lt; -0.253</td>      <td>Satisfactory</td>      <td>2.3</td>      <td>C+</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="mono">-1.036 ≤ x &lt; -0.674</td>      <td></td>      <td>2.0</td>      <td>C</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="mono">-1.44 ≤ x &lt; -1.036</td>      <td></td>      <td>1.7</td>      <td>C&minus;</td>    </tr>    <tr class="divider">      <td class="mono">-1.96 ≤ x &lt; -1.44</td>      <td>Poor</td>      <td>1.3</td>      <td>D+</td>    </tr>    <tr class="divider">      <td class="mono">-∞ ≤ x &lt; -1.96</td>      <td>Minimal Pass</td>      <td>1.0</td>      <td>D</td>    </tr>    <tr class="divider">      <td class="mono">NA (see Syllabus Passing Criteria)</td>      <td>Failure</td>      <td>0.0</td>      <td>F</td>    </tr>  </tbody>  <caption>    <strong>Letter Grade Boundaries</strong><br />    Table values are displayed rounded to three decimal places.
