        <summary>Minimum Criteria for a Passing Grade (D or higher)</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <br />
          <p>
            To earn a passing grade in the course, students must satisfy
            <strong>both</strong> of the following requirements. These criteria
            establish a fixed baseline of performance; meeting them does not
            guarantee a specific letter grade, but ensures that they will not
            receive an <strong>F</strong>.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2>1. Exam performance requirement</h2>

          <p>
            The weighted mean raw percentage score across the midterm and final
            exams must be &ge; 30%, calculated as:
          </p>

          <div class="equation" id="eq-pass-exams">
            \[ \text{Pass} = \frac{(\text{Midterm}\% \times 30\%) +
            (\text{Final}\% \times 35\%)}{30\% + 35\%} \ge 30\% \]
          </div>

          <p>
            The exam weights (30% midterm, 35% final) are taken from Table
            <span class="ref">course components</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Any weight adjustments applied elsewhere in
            the course (e.g., transfers from other assignments) do not change
            the calculation above; passing requires meeting the threshold based
            on the original exam weights.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2>2. Homework completion and performance requirement</h2>

          <p>
            Students must complete at least 60% of homework assignments and
            obtain a weighted mean raw percentage score &ge; 50% across those
            completed assignments.
          </p>

          <p>
            These requirements ensure that students demonstrate a minimum level
            of engagement and understanding in both cumulative exams and ongoing
            coursework before a passing grade can be assigned.
          </p>

          <br />

      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How Course Performance Is Evaluated</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <br />
          <p>
            Meeting the minimum passing requirements means you have demonstrated
            the basic learning outcomes of the course. Grades above that level
            are based on how strongly you performed, using a grading scale that
            adjusts for differences in assessment difficulty and is designed to
            match the University’s letter-grade descriptions more accurately
            than simple percentage cut-offs.
          </p>

          <p>
            To do this fairly, raw percentage scores from each assessment are
            converted to a common scale. This adjustment accounts for how hard
            or easy an assessment was and how spread out the scores were, so
            that no assessment unfairly helps or hurts your final grade. When
            all components are combined, each one contributes appropriately to
            the overall result.
          </p>

          <p>
            This approach does not set grade quotas, force a curve, or guarantee
            a fixed number of each letter grade. Your final grade depends only
            on your own performance relative to the class average and overall
            variation, not on how many other students receive a particular
            grade.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2>How raw percentages are rescaled</h2>

          <p>
            A student's raw score on each assessment (e.g., midterm, homework
            assignments, etc.) is converted to a standardized score using this
            equation:
          </p>

          <div class="equation" id="eq-std-score">
            \[ \text{Standardized Score} = \frac{\text{Raw Score} -
            \text{Median}}{\text{MADN}} \]
          </div>

          <p>
            “Raw Score” indicates a student's raw percent score on an assessment
            (e.g., the midterm). The “Median” and “MADN” summarize the
            statistical centre (i.e., average) and spread, respectively, for
            that assessment. Students may be less familiar with the notion of
            spread, but it matters because it shows how tightly or loosely
            scores are grouped around the average. This information helps
            interpret what a raw score really means.
          </p>

          <p>
            On this scale, 0 represents the class average. Positive values
            indicate above-average performance, with scores near or above +1
            reflecting clearly strong results. Negative values indicate
            below-average performance, with scores near or below &minus;1
            reflecting clearly weaker results. How these scores map to letter
            grades specifically can be seen in the table of letter grade
            boundaries below and in the syllabus.
          </p>

          <p>
            The standardized scores for each assessment are then combined as
            outlined in the "Combining assessments" section below.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em
              >Additional info can be found in the syllabus under the "Grade
              Evaluation" section.</em
            >
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2 id="sec-combine-scores">Combining assessments</h2>

          <p>
            The standardized scores of all assessments are combined using a
            weighted mean (weights are listed in the syllabus) to produce an
            overall course total. Because applying different weights to
            components may shift the centre and spread of the combined scores
            away from 0 and 1, respectively, this total is also converted to a
            standardized score so that the class median is again anchored at 0
            (B&minus;) with the same spread convention. This final step ensures
            that a student's overall score remains directly interpretable using
            the letter-grade boundaries found in the syllabus.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2>Assigning letter grades</h2>
          <p>
            Final letter grades are determined by comparing the overall course
            total described above to a fixed set of grade boundaries (see the
            table of letter grade boundaries below). These boundaries were
            established in advance, informed by historical student performance,
            instructor judgment, and the realities of aggregating values with
            comparable centres and spreads. They
            <strong>do not</strong> and <strong>cannot</strong> enforce a
            predetermined distribution of grades. Each student's grade depends
            only on their own performance relative to the class median and
            spread, not on how many classmates fall into each category.

      <h1>🤔 FAQ About Your Grades</h1>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          Why don't you just use the percentage scores like most classes?
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <br />
          <p>
            Raw percentages can be misleading because the same number can
            reflect very different levels of performance depending on the
            difficulty of the assessment. For example, 60% might be excellent on
            a challenging exam, whereas 85% might be average on an easier one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assigning letter grades directly from raw percentages requires the
            instructor to accurately anticipate 🔮 the centre (average) and
            spread (variability) of each assessment, as well as how those
            distributions will combine when course components are aggregated.
            Outside of a course that is taught and assessed in exactly the same
            way every term, making these predictions with meaningful precision
            is extremely difficult. As a result, most instructors rely on
            traditional percentage cut-offs (e.g., 90% = A) as a practical
            convention rather than the outcome of a carefully calibrated,
            course-specific grading model. This means that raw percentage scales
            can drift unpredictably from one assessment to the next, and from
            one course offering to the next, making their letter-grade
            interpretations inconsistent. An A in one course (or section) can
            therefore represent a very different level of difficulty, effort, or
            learning than an A in another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standardization avoids these problems. After standardization, the
            scale is consistent and interpretable across all assessments:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              0 always represents the class median (i.e., average performance)
            </li>
            <li>
              Positive values reflect above-median performance (around +1 =
              clearly strong performance).
            </li>
            <li>
              Negative values reflect below-median performance (around –1 =
              clearly weaker performance)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This approach prevents a hard exam or assignment from dragging down
            the entire class and stops an easy one from inflating grades. i.e.,
            the meaning of a score stays tied to performance, not difficulty.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the instructor's perspective, standardization also supports
            principled and transparent grade boundaries. Because each assessment
            is on a common scale with a known centre and spread, combining
            components yields overall scores with predictable structure (even
            though the distribution of letter grades is not predetermined). This
            makes grade boundaries easier to set and interpret and helps align
            final grades more closely with their intended meaning.
          </p>
          <br />
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          I don't understand any of this! Can you just give a simple example of
          why you believe standardization is beneficial?
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <br />
          <p>
            Yes. Imagine two quizzes worth the same weight in the course. One
            turns out to be very difficult, with a class average of 55%; the
            other is much easier, with a class average of 85%.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we used raw percentages directly, a score of 72% on the difficult
            quiz would appear worse than a score of 80% on the easy quiz, even
            though earning 72% on a hard assessment likely reflects stronger
            understanding than earning 80% on an easy one. Standardization
            corrects for this mismatch by placing both results on a common scale
            that reflects how each score compares to the class.
          </p>

          <p>
            After standardization, the two results become directly comparable:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The 72% score would appear above the standardized centre (0),
              indicating stronger performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 80% score would fall below the standardized centre (0),
              indicating weaker performance relative to peers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This makes averaging across assessments more meaningful because you
            are combining values expressed on the same scale, not raw
            percentages influenced by how forgiving or demanding a particular
            assessment happened to be.
          </p>

        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this the same as “grading on a curve”?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <br />
          <p>
            No. While both standardization and curving involve thinking about
            how student scores relate to the rest of the class, they are
            fundamentally different. Grading on a curve typically ranks students
            by performance and then assigns a fixed number of each letter grade
            (e.g., only the top 2.5% receive an A+), regardless of how well the
            class actually performed. This creates a zero-sum allocation: for
            one student to move up, another must move down, and the amount of
            each letter is capped in advance. Instructors using this approach
            impose a curve on the grade distribution rather than allowing the
            grade distribution to reflect the class's actual performance.

          <p>
            In contrast to that, this course does not use quotas or
            predetermined distributions. Instead, standardized scoring helps
            ensure fairness across assessments, and the actual number of A’s,
            B’s, C’s, etc. from how the class performs, not from an imposed
            formula — fully in line with University policy prohibiting mandatory
            curves. See the

            Only in a limited and generally healthy sense. Standardized scores
            are interpreted relative to the class median, so your performance is
            understood in relation to the class rather than in isolation. In
            that way, there is a mild competitive element: performing well
            relative to the class raises your standardized score, and performing
            below the class median lowers it.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, this does not mean that grades are capped or that students
            are ranked against one another. There are no quotas, no
            predetermined number of high grades, and no requirement that some
            students must receive lower grades for others to receive higher
            ones. If many students perform strongly, many students can earn
            strong grades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Put simply: your performance is interpreted in the context of the
            class, but your success does not come directly at someone else's
            expense.

            Not realistically. An A or A+ is meant to signal
            <i>extra</i>ordinary performance. i.e., achievement that clearly
            stands out from the rest of the class. If everyone earned the same
            top grade, then by definition no one’s performance would be
            extraordinary (it would be ordinary), and the grade would lose its
            meaning. Because scores are standardized around the class median,
            only those who perform well above that benchmark end up in the A
            range. In practice, this means that while many students can do well,
            top grades remain a mark of truly exceptional achievement.

          If the median is always 0 (B-), does that mean half the class will

        <div class="faq-content">

            No. The median is simply a sensible anchor point for the scale.
            Students above 0 are above average and may receive grades ranging
            from B- to A+; students below 0 are below average but may still earn
            passing grades (C's and D's). In most classes, the majority of
            students pass. The exact distribution of grades depends on how the
            whole class performs, not on a fixed quota.

          What does it mean that the grading method is "robust"?

        <div class="faq-content">
          <br />
          <p>
            In statistics, "robust" means that the method is not thrown off by
            unusual values or outliers. For example, if one student happens to
            score extremely low or extremely high, a robust method won’t let
            that single score shift the whole class’s average or spread. That’s
            why this system uses the median (the middle score) instead of the
            mean (the arithmetic average), and the MADN (a spread measure based
            on the median) instead of the standard deviation. These choices make
            the standardized scale more stable and fair, especially in classes
            where exams or assignments occasionally produce extreme results.

            After an assessment has been marked, you will receive both your raw
            score and your standardized score on your personal gradebook page.
            The standardized score is the one that counts toward your final
            grade. By comparing your standardized score to the published letter
            grade boundaries in the syllabus' Table, you can track your progress
            throughout the term. Additional stats and graphs will be provided as
            well to give you a sense of your standing as well.

          Can you show how to convert a raw score to a standardized score?
        </summary>

        <div class="faq-content">
          <br />
          <p>
            Yes. The standardized score is calculated in a way similar to a
            \(z\)-score, but it uses the class median and the normalized median
            absolute deviation (MADN). The formula is:
          </p>

          \[ s = \left(\frac{x - m}{\text{MADN}}\right) \]

          <p>
            where \(x\) is the raw score of an assessment, \(m\) is the class
            median, and MADN measures the spread.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Suppose a student gets a raw score of \(x = 88\)</li>
            <li>Suppose the class median on an assignment is \(m = 72\)</li>
            <li>Suppose the \(\text{MADN} = 11.9\), we therefore compute:</li>
          </ul>

          \[ \begin{align} s = \left( \frac{88 - 72}{11.9}\right) \approx 1.34
          \end{align} \] So, in this example, a raw score of 88 converts to a
          standardized score of about 1.34. This indicates performance well
          above the class average (0), and it would then be compared to the
          fixed letter grade boundaries in the syllabus.

            If you have questions, uncertainties, or well-reasoned concerns
            about how grading works in this course, I strongly encourage you to
            talk with me (your instructor) about them. The grading system is
            designed to be principled, transparent, and fair, but it is also
            unfamiliar to many students at first. Conversations are often
            helpful for clarifying how standardized scores are interpreted, how
            different components contribute to the final grade, and how this
            approach differs from traditional percentage cutoffs.
