            <p>1999remains a cultural and technological touchstone. 
              Its legacy endures in our nostalgia for a freer, 
              less commercialized internet and in the questions it raises 
              about progress. As we move further into the 21st century, we must 
              ask: what have we gained, and what have we lost? The world wide web 
              died in the year 2000, and any potential humanity had may have went with it.</p>
