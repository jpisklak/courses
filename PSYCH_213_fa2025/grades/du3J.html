What ultimately matters is your performance compared to the class as a whole, which is what both the z-score and standardized score represent.<br>Note:<br><ul><li>Assignments demonstrating effort (i.e., earning a minimal raw score) will not fall below a D on the standardized scale.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Median:</b> The class average.</li><br><li><b>MADN</b>: A robust measure of spread. It shows how far a student's grade is from the class median. Unlike the standard deviation, it isn't distorted by a few very high or very low scores, so it gives a fairer sense of overall performance variation. Though, in practice, you can broadly treat it like a standard deviation when interpreting your standing in the class.</li><br><li><b>Z:</b> This is your score as a robust standard score. It can be interpreted on the same scale as a conventional z-score, but instead of standard deviations from the mean, it is showing MADN's from the median. Z = 0 is the class average.</li><br><li><b>Standardized Score</b>: This is Z transformed to have a median of 50 and MADN of 25 (i.e., Z x 25 + 50). Thus, values above 50 are above average, below 50 are below average. The full interpretation of these scores can be seen in the table below. Note that this score is not bounded by 0 and 100, it extends from \( -\infty \) to \( +\infty \).</li><br><li><b>Weighted Score</b>: This is the weighted average of all your Standardized Scores (e.g., Homework 1, Homework 2, ... midterm, etc.).<br>Note:<br><ul><li>Even though the <i>Weighted Score</i> averages assessments with the same centre and spread, the unequal weights cause small shifts in the overall distribution. That's why we use the <i>Standardized Total</i> - to realign everything to a common scale.</li><li>Because weighted averaging is sensitive to extreme values (i.e., not robust), all <i>Standardized Scores</i> are floored to prevent distortions.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Standardized Total</b>: This is the <i>Weighted Score</i>, standardized to have a median of 50 and a MADN of 25. This is the value used to determine your letter grade in the course. The letter cutoffs are below. </li><br><li><b>Percentile Rank</b>: This is provided as an additional metric of your performance but is not used to determine your letter grade (as that would consitute "curving," which the University prohibits).</li></ul><p>For additional information about how and why your scores are standardized, please refer to either the syllabus or the "Grades" section of the course website.</p><br><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"><thead style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"><tr><th>Standardized Score</th><th>Interpretation</th><th>Grade Points</th><th>Letter Grade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\(91.12 < \infty\)</td><td>Outstanding</td><td>4.0</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>\(82.04 < 91.12\)</td><td>Excellent</td><td>4.0</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>\(75.91 < 82.04\)</td><td>Very Good</td><td>3.7</td><td>A–</td></tr><tr><td>\(66.86 < 75.91\)</td><td>Good</td><td>3.3</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>\(59.63 < 66.86\)</td><td>Above Average</td><td>3.0</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>\(50.00 < 59.63\)</td><td>Average</td><td>2.7</td><td>B–</td></tr><tr><td>\(40.37 < 50.00\)</td><td>Satisfactory</td><td>2.3</td><td>C+</td></tr><tr><td>\(33.14 < 40.37\)</td><td>Acceptable</td><td>2.0</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>\(24.09 < 33.14\)</td><td>Marginal</td><td>1.7</td><td>C–</td></tr><tr><td>\(17.96 < 24.09\)</td><td>Poor</td><td>1.3</td><td>D+</td></tr><tr><td>\(8.88 < 17.96\)</td><td>Minimal Pass</td><td>1.0</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>\(-\infty < 8.88\)</td><td>Failure</td><td>0.0</td><td>F</td></tr></tbody></table></details><script src="../../refresh.js"></script></main></body></html>
