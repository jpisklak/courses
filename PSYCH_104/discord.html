        <h1>Purpose of the Class Discord Server</h1>

        <p>The class Discord server is designed to enhance communication and foster 
            collaboration throughout the term. Here's what you can expect:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Class Forum</strong><br>
            The server includes a dedicated, Reddit-esque forum where you can 
            publicly ask the instructor and your fellow students questions about course material, 
            assignments, and exams. This ensures everyone can benefit from 
            shared answers and discussions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Student Collaboration</strong><br>
            A variety of text and voice channels are available for you to 
            connect with your classmates. Use these spaces to discuss lecture 
            topics, work on group projects, share study tips, or form study groups.
          </li>
        </ol>


        <h1>Accessing the Class Discord Server</h1>

        <p>To join the class Discord server, you'll need an invitation link. 
        This will be provided during the first lecture. 
        </p>

        <p>If the invitation link has expired,
        please <a href = "contact.html">contact</a> the instructor or teaching assistant to request a new invitation link.</p>
        
        <p>We look forward to seeing you on Discord!</p>
