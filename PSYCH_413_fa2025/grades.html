        <h1>üßÆ How Your Grade Is Calculated</h1>

        <p>
        All assessments in this course are standardized so that the <strong>median score</strong> is set to 50 and the <strong>MADN (Median Absolute Deviation, normalized)</strong> is set to 25.
        </p>
        <p>
        The scale is designed to feel intuitive: values near 0 always represent very low performance, values near 100 always represent very high performance, and 50 always represents the class average.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each standardized score is then averaged according to the weights listed in Table&nbsp;3 of the syllabus to produce a course total.  
        Because this weighting can introduce small shifts in the distribution, the totals are standardized once more.  
        The final standardized score is then compared against the letter grade cutoffs shown in Table&nbsp;2 of the syllabus.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h1>ü§î FAQ About Your Grades</h1>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why are you standardising?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>Raw scores can be misleading, because the same number can mean very different things depending on how hard the assessment is. For example, a score of 60% might be excellent on a very difficult exam, while 85% might be only average on an easier one. Using raw scores would then force the instructor to set arbitrary and sometimes confusing letter boundaries.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        By standardising the scores instead, the scale is consistent and unambiguous: 50 always represents the class average, higher values reflect above-average performance, and lower values reflect below-average performance. This ensures that a very hard exam does not drag the entire class down, and an easy exam does not inflate everyone's grades‚Äîthe standardized scale keeps grades tied to their intended meaning.</p>
        </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why are you using the median and MADN statistics?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>The <b>median</b> score is a <i>robust</i> measure of the class average. Similarly, the <b>MADN</b> is a <i>robust</i> measure of spread. In statistics, "robust" means that the method is not thrown off by unusual values or outliers. For example, if one student happens to score extremely low or extremely high, a robust method won‚Äôt let that single score shift the whole class's average or spread. These choices make the standardized scale more stable and fair, especially in classes where exams or assignments occasionally produce extreme results.</p>
        </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I convert a raw score to a standardized value? Can you show an example?</summary><br>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>You don't need to calculate this yourself‚Äîthe gradebook does it automatically. But if you'd like to double-check, the standardized score is computed much like a z-score, except it uses the <strong>class median</strong> as the centre and the <strong>normalized median absolute deviation (MADN)</strong> as the measure of spread. The formula is:</p>

        \[
            s = \left(\frac{x - m}{\text{MADN}}\right) \times 25 + 50
        \]

        <p>where \(x\) is the raw score, \(m\) is the class median, and MADN measures the spread. The constants 25 and 50 set the scale so that one MADN corresponds to 25 points, and the class median corresponds to 50.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Suppose the class median on an assignment is \(m = 72\)</li>
            <li>Suppose the \(\text{MADN} = 11.9\)</li>
            <li>For a student with a raw score of \(x = 88\), we compute:</li>
        </ul>

                \[
                \begin{align}
                  s &= \left( \frac{88 - 72}{11.9}\right) \times 25 + 50 \\[1em]
                  &\approx 83.6
                  \end{align}
                \]

        So, in this example, a raw score of 88 converts to a standardized score of about 83.6. This indicates performance well above the class average (50), and it would then be compared to the fixed letter grade boundaries in Table 2 of the syllabus.

            <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How do I combine/average all my scores by their weights?</summary><br>
            <div class="faq-content">

            <p>Your gradebook already does this for you; however, if you want to double-check, use a weighted average (a.k.a. weighted mean):</p>
            <p>Suppose you completed two assignments and a midterm and their scores and weights are as follows:</p>

            <table style="width: 35%">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Assessment</th>
                <th>Score</th>
                <th>Weight</th>
            </tr></thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Assign. 1</td>
                <td>62</td>
                <td>8</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Assign. 2</td>
                <td>59</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Midterm</td>
                <td>43</td>
                <td>20</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Just multiply each score by it's weight, add the products, and divide by the sum of the weights:</p>

            <p>
            \[
                \begin{align}
                    \text{Overall} &= \frac{(8 \times 62) + (10 \times 59) + (20 \times 43)}{8 + 10 + 20} \\[1em]
                    &= \frac{496 + 590 + 860}{38} \\[1em]
                    & \approx 51.21 
                  \end{align}
            \]
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>The formula looks like this:</p>

            <p>
            \[
                \text{Overall} \;=\; 
                \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \, s_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i}
            \]
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>\(s_i = \) score for assignment \(i\).</li>
                <li>\(w_i = \) for assignment \(i\).</li>
                <li>\(k = \) number of assessments.</li>
            </ul>
            </details>
            </div>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this the same as "grading on a curve''?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>No. A curve predetermines how many students can receive each letter grade, often based on a fixed distribution (e.g., only the top 5% of students get an A+). This course uses no quotas. The number of A's, B's, C's, etc., emerges from the class's actual performance, not an imposed formula ‚Äî fully in line with University policy prohibiting mandatory curves.

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How can I estimate my standing during the term?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>You don't need to calculate your standing yourself‚Äîyour gradebook page does it automatically. However, if you'd like to double-check, you can. The gradebook shows not only your standardized score, but also your raw score along with the class median and MADN. Using these, you can verify your standardized score and compare it against the letter-grade boundaries published in Table 2 of the syllabus. This way, both the number and the assigned letter grade can be independently confirmed.</a></p>
        </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this grading system competitive?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>Not in the sense of fixed quotas or forced scarcity. Your grade does not depend on ‚Äúbeating‚Äù a certain number of classmates, and there is no preset limit on how many A's, B's, or C's can be awarded. That being said, strong performance is still rewarded: students who consistently perform well above the average earn higher standardized scores and thus higher letter grades.</a></p>
        </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can everyone get an A?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>Not realistically. An A or A+ is meant to signal <i>extra</i>ordinary performance ‚Äî achievement that clearly stands out from the rest of the class. If everyone earned the same top grade, then by definition no one's performance would be extraordinary (it would be ordinary), and the grade would lose its meaning. Because scores are standardized around the class median, only those who perform well above that benchmark end up in the A range. In practice, this means that while many students can do well, top grades remain a mark of truly exceptional achievement.</a></p>
        </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>If the median is always set to 50 (B-), does that mean half the class will fail?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>No. The median is simply an anchor point for the scale. Students above 50 are above average and may receive grades ranging from B- to A+; students below 50 are below average but may still earn passing grades (C's and D's). In most classes, the majority of students pass. The exact distribution of grades depends on how the whole class performs, not on a fixed quota.</a></p>
        </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does this system disadvantage strong students?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>No. Because ranks are preserved, students who consistently perform well compared to their peers will always receive higher standardized scores and higher letter grades.</a></p>

        <summary>Why don't you use Canvas for this?</summary>
