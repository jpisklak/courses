      <h1>🔍 How to View Your Assignment Scores and Course Performance</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Each student will receive a unique random ID (e.g.,
          <code>YUrZ</code>). This will be emailed after the add/drop deadline
          (September 15).
        </li>
        <li>
          Use this ID to access your personal gradebook by inserting it into the
          following web address:
          <code
            >https://jpisklak.github.io/courses/PSYCH_413_fa2025/<b
              >grades/YUrZ</b
            ></code
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Your gradebook page will display your assignment scores, class
          statistics, and—most importantly—your current letter grade.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Do not share this ID (unless you want the world to know how
        <i>you</i> are performing in the class).

      <h1>🧮 How Your Grade Is Calculated</h1>

      <p>
        All assessments in this course are standardized so that the
        <strong>median score</strong> is set to 50 and the
        <strong>MADN (Median Absolute Deviation, normalized)</strong> is set to
        25.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scale is designed to feel intuitive: values near 0 always represent
        very low performance, values near 100 always represent very high
        performance, and 50 always represents the class average.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each standardized score is then averaged according to the weights listed
        in Table&nbsp;3 of the syllabus to produce a course total. Because this
        weighting can introduce small shifts in the distribution, the totals are
        standardized once more. The final standardized score is then compared
        against the letter grade cutoffs shown in Table&nbsp;2 of the syllabus.
      </p>

      <h1>🤔 FAQ About Your Grades</h1>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why are you standardising?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p> Raw percentage scores can be misleading because the same number can reflect very different levels of
          performance depending on the difficulty of the assessment. For example, a score of 60% might be excellent on a
          challenging exam, while 85% could be only average on an easier one. In essense, basic percentage scores fail
          to take into account
          how the
          class performed as a whole, which makes it difficult to set meaningful grade boundaries in advance and can
          contribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_inflation" target="_blank">grade inflation</a>,
          since instructors often feel pressured to award higher marks. </p>
        <p> Standardizing scores, by contrast, evaluates your performance based on how far above or below the class
          average you are (i.e., you are evaluated relative to your peers). This approach ensures that a difficult
          assessment does not
          unfairly lower everyone’s grades, and that an easy one does not artificially inflate them. The standardized
          scale keeps grades tied to their intended meaning at the University, providing a fairer and more consistent
          measure of achievement. If all instructors adopted a similar system, grades would be more equitable across
          different sections of the same course, regardless of how easy or difficult a particular course happened to
          be.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why are you using the median and MADN statistics?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            The <b>median</b> score is a <i>robust</i> measure of the class
            average. Similarly, the <b>MADN</b> is a <i>robust</i> measure of
            spread. In statistics, "robust" means that the method is not thrown
            off by unusual values or outliers. For example, if one student
            happens to score extremely low or extremely high, a robust method
            won't let that single score shift the whole class's average or
            spread. These choices make the standardized scale more stable and
            fair, especially in classes where exams or assignments occasionally
            produce extreme results.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this the same as "grading on a curve?"</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          No. Grading on a curve predetermines how many students can receive each letter
          grade. i.e., Students are ranked and only the top \(x\)% of
          students get an A+, the next \(x\)% get an A, the next \(x\)% get an A- and so on. This course uses no quotas. The number of A's,
          B's, C's, etc., emerges from the class's actual performance, not an
          imposed formula — fully in line with University policy prohibiting
          mandatory curves. See

          How do I convert a raw score to a standardized value? Can you show an
          example?
        </summary>
        <br />
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            You don't need to calculate this yourself—the gradebook does it
            automatically. But if you'd like to double-check, the standardized
            score is computed much like a z-score, except it uses the
            <strong>class median</strong> as the centre and the
            <strong>normalized median absolute deviation (MADN)</strong> as the
            measure of spread. The formula is:
          </p>

          \[ s = \left(\frac{x - m}{\text{MADN}}\right) \times 25 + 50 \]

          <p>
            where \(x\) is the raw score, \(m\) is the class median, and MADN
            measures the spread. The constants 25 and 50 set the scale so that
            one MADN corresponds to 25 points, and the class median corresponds
            to 50.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Suppose the class median on an assignment is \(m = 72\)</li>
            <li>Suppose the \(\text{MADN} = 11.9\)</li>
            <li>For a student with a raw score of \(x = 88\), we compute:</li>
          </ul>

          \[ \begin{align} s &= \left( \frac{88 - 72}{11.9}\right) \times 25 +
          50 \\[1em] &\approx 83.6 \end{align} \] So, in this example, a raw
          score of 88 converts to a standardized score of about 83.6. This
          indicates performance well above the class average (50), and it would
          then be compared to the fixed letter grade boundaries in Table 2 of
          the syllabus.

          How do I combine/average all my scores by their weights?
        </summary>
        <br />
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            Your gradebook already does this for you; however, if you want to
            double-check, use a weighted average (a.k.a. weighted mean):
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose you completed two assignments and a midterm and their scores
            and weights are as follows:
          </p>

          <table style="width: 35%">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Assessment</th>
                <th>Score</th>
                <th>Weight</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Assign. 1</td>
                <td>62</td>
                <td>8</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Assign. 2</td>
                <td>59</td>
                <td>10</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Midterm</td>
                <td>43</td>
                <td>20</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>
            Just multiply each score by it's weight, add the products, and
            divide by the sum of the weights:
          </p>

          <p>
            \[ \begin{align} \text{Overall} &= \frac{(8 \times 62) + (10 \times
            59) + (20 \times 43)}{8 + 10 + 20} \\[1em] &= \frac{496 + 590 +
            860}{38} \\[1em] & \approx 51.21 \end{align} \]
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>The formula looks like this:</p>

          <p>
            \[ \text{Overall} \;=\; \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \,
            s_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i} \]
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>\(s_i = \) score for assignment \(i\).</li>
            <li>\(w_i = \) for assignment \(i\).</li>
            <li>\(k = \) number of assessments.</li>

          <p>
            You don't need to calculate your standing yourself—your gradebook
            page does it automatically. However, if you'd like to double-check,
            you can. The gradebook shows not only your standardized score, but
            also your raw score along with the class median and MADN. Using
            these, you can verify your standardized score and compare it against
            the letter-grade boundaries published in Table 2 of the syllabus.
            This way, both the number and the assigned letter grade can be
            independently confirmed.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this grading system competitive?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            Not in the sense of fixed quotas or forced scarcity. Your grade does
            not depend on “beating” a certain number of classmates, and there is
            no preset limit on how many A's, B's, or C's can be awarded. That
            being said, strong performance is still rewarded: students who
            consistently perform well above the average earn higher standardized
            scores and thus higher letter grades.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can everyone get an A?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            Not realistically. An A or A+ is meant to signal
            <i>extra</i>ordinary performance — achievement that clearly stands
            out from the rest of the class. If everyone earned the same top
            grade, then by definition no one's performance would be
            extraordinary (it would be ordinary), and the grade would lose its
            meaning. Because scores are standardized around the class median,
            only those who perform well above that benchmark end up in the A
            range. In practice, this means that while many students can do well,
            top grades remain a mark of truly exceptional achievement.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          If the median is always set to 50 (B-), does that mean half the class
          will fail?
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            No. The median is simply an anchor point for the scale. Students
            above 50 are above average and may receive grades ranging from B- to
            A+; students below 50 are below average but may still earn passing
            grades (C's and D's). In most classes, the majority of students
            pass. The exact distribution of grades depends on how the whole
            class performs, not on a fixed quota.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does this system disadvantage strong students?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            No. Because ranks are preserved, students who consistently perform
            well compared to their peers will always receive higher standardized
            scores and higher letter grades.
