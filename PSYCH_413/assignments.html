        <h1>Homework Assignments</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Homework questions will be assigned each Friday and available here by 17:00.</li>
            <li>Submit your homework as a well-organized IPYNB file (e.g., a Google Colab notebook) through the submission portal that will be provided on this page.</li>
            <li>Homework assignments are due the following Friday by 23:59.</li>
            <li>Please do not email the instructor or TA your homework assignments. Only assignments submitted using the portal will be accepted.</li>
            <li>Solutions will be visible after the due date has passed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        If you need assistance getting your code to work feel free to email the instructor. However, when you do, make sure you have done the following:
            <ol>
                <li>üîç Find and remove other errors that might be lurking in your code: Select <i>"Runtime"</i> in top drop-down menu and then <i>"Restart Session and Run All"</i>. 
                    Then fix any new/extra errors you find above your original error and repeat this process until there are no errors.</li>
                <li>‚úÇÔ∏è Eliminate any redundant or unnecessary code (i.e., lines that duplicate the function of others). 
                    Writing excessive code increases the likelihood of errors, so streamline your script by removing anything superfluous.</li>
                <li>üßπ Structure, organize, and comment your code clearly and neatly. 
                    Clean and well-organized code makes it much easier to identify typos or other issues. 
                    Additionally, starting around the midpoint of the term, your code will be graded on its organization and presentation, 
                    so it‚Äôs important to develop good habits now.

                <li>üìß When all else fails, email the instructor with a description of the problem and 
                    share your Colab notebook (using Google's "share" button in the top right corner).  DO NOT SEND SCREEN SHOTS.</li>
            </ol>
