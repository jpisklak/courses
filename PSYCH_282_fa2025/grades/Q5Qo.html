While they outline the general characteristics of different performance levels, they cannot fully capture the variety and nuance of every individual submission.In such cases, the TA and I apply our professional judgment to determine where your work most closely fits in terms of the scoring criteria. Our goal is always to assess fairly and consistently while respecting the complexity of nuanced academic work.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about your score, please contact our TA, Sarah (smeltz@ualberta.ca), first. Be sure your questions are specific and thoughtful—for example, point to particular criteria or examples from your work. Finally, keep in mind that completing the minimum requirements does not automatically guarantee full marks; the quality, clarity, and depth of your work are all considered in the evaluation.</p></div></details><details class="grade-item"><summary>Midterm 1</summary><div class="grade-content"><p>Raw Score = 28.57%<br>Median = 65.71%<br>MADN = 12.71%<br><br>Z = -2<br>Standardized Score: 0<br>Weight: 25%</p><strong>Scored Responses:</strong> <code>bEaCd ACDda ccdca Accca AabCb acded DaCab</code></div></details><details class="grade-item"><summary>Midterm 2</summary><div class="grade-content"><p>Raw Score = 40%<br>Median = 62.86%<br>MADN = 25.42%<br><br>Z = -0.899<br>Standardized Score: 27.52<br>Weight: 25%</p><strong>Scored Responses:</strong> <code>ACBaC Cdddc bcBcc EBbDc baDdc cBcdE BcddE</code></div></details><br><hr><br><details class="grade-item"><summary>Course Total</summary><div class="grade-content"><p>Weighted Score: 16.03<br>Median = 47.96<br>MADN = 26.33<p><b>Z = -1.213</b><br><b>Standardized Total = 19.68</b><br><strong>Current Letter Grade: D+</strong></p>Percentile Rank: 12<br>Your percentile rank shows the percentage of students whose performance is below yours.<br>This means you are currently outperforming about 12% of the class.</p><br><h2>Class Distribution</h2><img src = 'class_dist.svg'><p>Each short tick mark below the curve represents an individual student's score.</p><br></div></details><br><script src="../../refresh.js"></script></main></body></html><details><summary>👆 Description of values (click to view)</summary><ul><li><b>Raw Score:</b> This is your raw percentage score for an assessment. <i>This value is ONLY meaningful when viewed relative to the class;</i> specifically, in relation to the median and MADN statistics. What ultimately matters is your performance compared to the class as a whole, which is what both the z-score and standardized score represent.<br>Note:<br><ul><li>Assignments demonstrating effort (i.e., earning a minimal raw score) will not fall below a D on the standardized scale.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Median:</b> The class average.</li><br><li><b>MADN</b>: A measure of spread analogous to standard deviation. Unlike the standard deviation, it isn't distorted by a few very high or very low scores, so it gives a fairer sense of overall performance variation. Though, in practice, you can broadly treat it like a standard deviation when interpreting your standing in the class.</li><br><li><b>Z:</b> This is your score as a robust standard score. It can be interpreted on the same scale as a conventional z-score you learn about in introductory statistics courses, but instead of standard deviations from the mean, it is showing MADN's from the median. Z = 0 is the class average.</li><br><li><b>Standardized Score</b>: This is just Z transformed to have a median of 50 and MADN of 25 (i.e., Z x 25 + 50). Thus, values above 50 are above average, below 50 are below average. The full interpretation of these scores can be seen in the table below.</li><br><li><b>Weighted Score</b>: This is the weighted average of all your Standardized Scores (e.g., Homework 1, Homework 2, ... midterm, etc.).<br>Note:<br><ul><li>Even though the <i>Weighted Score</i> averages assessments with the same centre and spread, the unequal weights cause small shifts in the overall distribution. That's why we use the <i>Standardized Total</i> - to realign everything to a common scale.</li><li>Because weighted averaging is sensitive to extreme values (i.e., not robust), all <i>Standardized Scores</i> are floored to prevent distortions.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Standardized Total</b>: This is the <i>Weighted Score</i>, standardized to have a median of 50 and a MADN of 25. This is the value used to determine your letter grade in the course. The letter cutoffs are below. </li><br><li><b>Percentile Rank</b>: This is provided as an additional metric of your performance but is not used to determine your letter grade (as that would consitute "curving," which the University prohibits).</li></ul><p>For additional information about how and why your scores are standardized, please refer to either the syllabus or the "Grades" section of the course website.</p><br><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"><thead style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"><tr><th>Standardized Score</th><th>Interpretation</th><th>Grade Points</th><th>Letter Grade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\(91.12 < \infty\)</td><td>Outstanding</td><td>4.0</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>\(82.04 < 91.12\)</td><td>Excellent</td><td>4.0</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>\(75.91 < 82.04\)</td><td>Very Good</td><td>3.7</td><td>A–</td></tr><tr><td>\(66.86 < 75.91\)</td><td>Good</td><td>3.3</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>\(59.63 < 66.86\)</td><td>Above Average</td><td>3.0</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>\(50.00 < 59.63\)</td><td>Average</td><td>2.7</td><td>B–</td></tr><tr><td>\(40.37 < 50.00\)</td><td>Satisfactory</td><td>2.3</td><td>C+</td></tr><tr><td>\(33.14 < 40.37\)</td><td>Acceptable</td><td>2.0</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>\(24.09 < 33.14\)</td><td>Marginal</td><td>1.7</td><td>C–</td></tr><tr><td>\(17.96 < 24.09\)</td><td>Poor</td><td>1.3</td><td>D+</td></tr><tr><td>\(8.88 < 17.96\)</td><td>Minimal Pass</td><td>1.0</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>\(-\infty < 8.88\)</td><td>Failure</td><td>0.0</td><td>F</td></tr></tbody></table></details><script src="../../refresh.js"></script></main></body></html>
