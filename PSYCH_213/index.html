        <h1>🌐 Welcome to our Course Website 🌐</h1>
        <p>
             You might be wondering, 
            "<i>Why does this page look like it was coded on a Windows 95 machine?</i>"  It's because we are going to use Canvas as little as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>The Deal with Canvas:</h2>
        <p>
            After using Canvas for three courses last semester, I can confidently state that (on the instructor-side of things) it was a nice exercise in frustration.
            So, I've gone rogue and created something much better: a simple, fast, and refreshingly basic 
            HTML page with no pointless notifications and no cumbersome fluff. Think of it 
            as a love letter to the <a href = "https://geocities.restorativland.org/" target ="_blank">golden era of the internet</a>, when websites 
            were fun, snappy, straightforward, and (most importantly) interesting. 🌟
        </p>

        <h2>What This Means for You:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>🚀 Faster Loading:</strong> No waiting for Canvas to think about whether it feels like opening your page today.</li>
            <li><strong>🧼 Zero Clutter:</strong> Just the info you need—clean, organized, and easy to find!</li>
            <li><strong>🎨 Customizable Coolness:</strong> We could (in theory) add a touch of fun while keeping everything straightforward. Maybe there will be easter eggs?</li>
            <li><strong>🕹️Retro vibes, modern convenience:</strong> You’re getting a taste of the 90s internet with none of the dial-up agony.</li>
            <li><strong>📁No hidden corners:</strong> Everything is laid out like a well-organized desktop (yes, that was a thing once).</li>
            <li><strong>🔒 No Sneaky Data Snatching: </strong>This site isn’t spying on you, tracking your clicks, or asking for your life story. It's here to teach, not sell your data to the highest bidder.</li>
            <li><strong>🔕 No Pointless Alerts:</strong> This site won’t flood your inbox with "important updates" about things you don't need to care about. It respects your peace and quiet!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Bookmark this page (Ctrl+D or Command+D) for easy access.
